## My_Linear_Regression
Getting and analysing existing data is the very first task of a data scientist. The next step is to find tendencies and to generalize. Another way of generalizing is by creating a model from the existing examples and make prediction based on that model.So 
feature_2 = θ0 + θ1 . feature_1. We then need to define a performance measure (how well the model performs) or a cost function (how bad the model performs).
These kind of problems and models are called Linear Regression.
The goal of this journey is to explore linear and logistic regressions.
